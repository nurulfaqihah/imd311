            This is my best friend since school. I represent my friends who names, Sitinur Balqis Binti Saiful Nahar from Pulau Pinang, Umie Nadia Binti Md Adnan from Pulau Pinang. We have known since form 1. At the first place,I don't expect that we will be close until now but each of them has made their own journey and its kinda difficult to contact.

            We always eat together at canteen hostel and school. Play such a kid and the things that i always remember eat nasi lemak at assembly point. When I reminisce, I realize we can't go back to the way we were before. We always mess with each other no matter what day or night. Crying, laughing, disappointed together. Thank you for ever being present in my life and I appreciate it.Maybe we are far from each other but remember that I am always aware of your situation and still remember you.

        This is my best friend University. At picture first I represent my friends who names, Nur Hasanah Binti Othman from Kedah, second picture Nursyafiqah Aqilah Binti Zulkefli from Kuala Lumpur. We have known since sem 1 but i think early then that which means before we know each others class. By the way,I don't expect that we will be close until now because it can be said that everyone does their own thing. My first impression of Hasanah, she looks good, cute and polite while for Qila she looks smart and beautiful.

        We already makes a lot of memory one of them we healing together. Thankyou for everything. Thankyou for share everything with me and always there for me whether sad, happy and so on. To be honest, I can't bear to go through our last day together. Missing must be missed but everyone will be busy. Remember, take care of yourself no matter where you are and don't forget me.
